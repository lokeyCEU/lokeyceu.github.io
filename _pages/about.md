### About Me
My career has been motivated by a determination to understand evolution. In this pursuit I found a love for population genetics, quantitative genetics, statistical methods, and data science. My goal is to apply the skills I cultivate to real-world problems. During my PhD I contributed to the development of computational genetic methods that improve conservation efforts. I believe that computational biology and genetics has an important part to play in improving human health, agriculture, and conservation to make a better future for everyone and I am excited to be a part of it.

### PhD Research
I am currently a PhD candidate in the department of Molecular Biology & Genetics in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. My dissertation work focuses on understanding the interplay of population genetic processes in shaping deleterious variation in populations of conservation concern. Although natural selection deterministically acts to decrease the frequency of deleterious genetic variation, population size changes, especially to low sizes, increase the stochastic process of random genetic drift. Furthermore, the combined distributions of dominance and fitness effects of deleterious variants greatly impacts the evolutionary trajectory of such mutations. As we seek to utilize genomic data for conservation we need to elucidate the combined roles of demography, inbreeding, dominance, drift, and selection in shaping expected burdens of deleterious variation for populations of conservation concern. I've sought to contribute to this effort and add principled methods and recommendations for using genomic tools to improve conservation management.
