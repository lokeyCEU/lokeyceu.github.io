<header> <h3>Florida Scrub-jay</h3>  </header>
The Florida Scrub-jay (<b>FSJ</b>) are the only bird endemic to the Florida peninsula and the only scrub-jay found outside Western North America. Over the last 200 years anthropogenic driven habitat destruction has caused a precipitous decline of the species. As a non-migratory bird with limited dispersal confined to it's xeric scrub habitat, human development has fragmented the species into semi-isolated subpopulations across their former range. Using whole-genome sequencing from 5 demographically diverse subpopulations representing 3 genetic metapopulations we use the FSJ as a natural experiment of the genetic impacts of population decline, reduced migration, and management.

My efforts in this project were to;
<ul>
  <li>Quantify the burden of deleterious variation in a non-model organism</li>
  <li>Assess how poulation size history, migration, and inbreeding shaped the deleterious burden across subpopulations</li>
  <li>Assess the utility of population genetic summaries of deleterious variation in predicting population outcomes</li>
  <li>Use these results to inform conservation efforts</li>
</ul>
